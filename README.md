# 7 Weeks of Questionable Passthrough and XR

## This is a better log of what I am doing this summer

June 13th 
Today I decided to either go with AR snapchat lenses or Passthrough VR.

- Step 1 make a new unity project.
    ->Figure out if its even feasible to do this for 49 days straight.
    -> Research: basic how to even start.

For reference, the world beyond demo is a good starting spot.

Note the demo does not work after building apk initially.

- Step 2 make a github repo 
    (what youre seeing now!)
    
- Step 3 - Brainstorm what I will make
(secrets to be documented as the week goes on)
